# Boids

## Overview
Boids is a simulation of flocking behavior, implemented in Python using the Pygame library for visualization. The simulation creates a flock of 'Boid' objects and simulates their movement within a window, using certain rules to govern their behavior.

## What the Code Does
The code creates a 'flock' of 'Boid' objects, each with properties like position, velocity, and acceleration. In each iteration of the simulation, the 'Boids' interact with each other based on certain rules, adjusting their velocities accordingly. This results in emergent flocking behavior, with the 'Boids' moving together in a coordinated manner.

## Algorithms/Approaches Used
The code uses object-oriented programming to define the 'Boid' class and its methods. The flocking behavior is implemented using a simple rule-based system, where each 'Boid' adjusts its velocity based on the positions and velocities of other 'Boids' in its vicinity.

## Real-World Applications
Simulations like this can be used in a variety of fields, from computer graphics (for animating flocks of birds or schools of fish) to robotics (for coordinating the movements of a swarm of robots). They can also be used in research to study emergent behavior and flocking dynamics.
